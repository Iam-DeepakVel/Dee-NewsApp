This project is a daily news platform that provides users with the latest news articles and breaking news updates. The platform is built using Next.js, which is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered applications. TypeScript, a statically-typed language, is also used to enhance the development experience by providing type-checking and better code readability.

For styling, React-Bootstrap, a popular UI library, is utilized. It provides pre-built components that are responsive and easy to use, enabling faster development and better user experience.

To fetch the latest news, the NewsAPI is used. NewsAPI is a RESTful API that provides news articles from various sources. It allows developers to fetch and integrate news content into their applications, making it an excellent choice for this project.

Overall, this project provides users with a modern and efficient way to consume news content. With its use of modern technologies, users can expect a fast, responsive, and reliable news platform that meets their daily needs.
